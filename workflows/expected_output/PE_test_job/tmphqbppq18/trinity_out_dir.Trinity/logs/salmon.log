[2019-02-20 07:52:47.651] [jointLog] [info] Computed 226 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-02-20 07:52:47.651] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2026 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-02-20 07:52:47.655] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2026 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2019-02-20 07:52:47.655] [jointLog] [warning] Since only 2026 (< 5000000) fragments were observed, modeling of the fragment start position distribution has been disabled
