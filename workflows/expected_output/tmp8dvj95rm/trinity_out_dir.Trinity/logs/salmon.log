[2019-02-05 14:33:49.942] [jointLog] [info] Computed 334 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2019-02-05 14:33:49.942] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2282 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2019-02-05 14:33:49.950] [jointLog] [warning] Only 2282 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.

[2019-02-05 14:33:49.950] [jointLog] [warning] Since only 2282 (< 5000000) fragments were observed, modeling of the fragment start position distribution has been disabled
