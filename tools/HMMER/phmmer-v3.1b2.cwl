label: "Search a single protein sequence against a protein sequence database. (BLASTP-like)"

doc: |
      The phmmer and jackhmmer programs search a single protein sequence against a protein sequence
      database, akin to BLASTP and PSIBLAST, respectively. (Internally, they just produce a profile HMM from
      the query sequence, then run HMM searches.)
      Please visit https://github.com/EddyRivasLab/hmmer for full documentation.
